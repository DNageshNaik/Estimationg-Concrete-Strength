# Estimationg-Concrete-Strength
Generally concrete  compressive strength is estimated using the test of concrete cubes. Which requires a lot of time,man and machine power. So the goal is to create an ml algorithm for the prediction of concrete compressive strength.

Developed a Machine Learning Model in order to estimate the compressive strength of concrete, Extracted the best possible results using Random Forest Regression Model with an accuracy of 89%, Improved the accuracy further by 5% on test data by performing Multivariate Feature Engineering
